# **Pxhog - Shopify + PostHog Made Easy**

Pxhog is an open-source Shopify app designed to simplify and streamline the integration of PostHog analytics for Shopify merchants. Whether you're an experienced developer or a Shopify merchant with little to no coding experience, Pxhog helps you set up PostHog the **right way**, ensuring integration with Shopify Customer Privacy API for privacy compliance and using the Shopify Web Pixel feature.

## **Motiviation**

Integrating PostHog into Shopify can be a challenging and error-prone process, even for seasoned developers. It involves navigating multiple technical steps, understanding complex compliance requirements. This complexity often becomes a **friction point** for merchants exploring PostHog for Shopify.

- **Efficiency**: Saves developers and merchants hours of integration time into Shopify and reducing the potential for mistakes.

## **Features**

- **Full Control via GUI**: A flexible graphical interface allows merchants and developers to fine-tune all PostHog configuration properties and Web Pixel events, giving you full control over your setup.
- **Documentation Hub**: Accompanies a dedicated documentation site with a clear, opinionated guide on how to use PostHog effectively with Shopify.
