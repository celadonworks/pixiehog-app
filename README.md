# **Pxhog - Shopify + PostHog Made Easy**

Pxhog is a Shopify app designed to simplify and streamline the integration of PostHog analytics for Shopify merchants. Whether you're an experienced developer or a Shopify merchant with little to no coding experience, Pxhog helps you set up PostHog the **right way**, ensuring integration with [Shopify Customer Privacy API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer-privacy) for privacy compliance and using the [Shopify Web Pixels API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api).

## **Motiviation**

Integrating PostHog into Shopify can be a challenging and error-prone process, even for seasoned developers. It involves navigating multiple technical steps, understanding complex compliance requirements. This complexity often becomes a **friction point** for merchants exploring PostHog for Shopify.

Pxhog solves these problems by providing:
- **Simplicity**: A seamless setup process that abstracts away the technical complexity.
- **Compliance**: Built-in integration with the [Shopify Customer Privacy API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer-privacy) ensures that all tracking respects user consent, sending anonymized data when necessary or detailed data when permitted.
- **Accessibility**: Makes PostHog accessible to merchants with no coding experience.
- **Efficiency**: Saves developers and merchants hours of integration time into Shopify and reducing the potential for mistakes.

## **Features**

- **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Install Pxhog on your Shopify store and start tracking with PostHog in minutes.
- **Privacy-First Tracking**:
  - Sends anonymized data when user consent is pending or declined.
  - Captures full, detailed data when user consent is granted, fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws.
- **Opinionated Defaults**: Comes with a pre-configured setup to track key events like `checkout_completed`, `page_viewed`, and `product_added_to_cart` Web Pixel events.
- **Full Control via GUI**: A flexible graphical interface allows merchants and developers to fine-tune all PostHog configuration properties and [Web Pixels Standard & DOM events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events), giving you full control over your setup.
- **Documentation Hub**: Accompanies a dedicated documentation site with a clear, opinionated guide on how to use PostHog effectively with Shopify.
